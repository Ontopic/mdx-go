# CSS-in-JS

Any CSS-in-JS library will work with mdx-go.
When [exporting as static HTML](/exporting), mdx-go includes server-side rendering support for [emotion][] and [styled-components][].

To make use of the built-in layout components, you'll need to install [emotion][] or [styled-components][].

[styled-components]: https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components
